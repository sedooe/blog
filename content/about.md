I'm a Software Developer and Software Engineering <del>student</del> graduate based in Izmir, Turkey.

I consider myself a passionate developer. Actually, not just about software development, I'm passionate about everything I like to do. Years ago, when I was a secondary school kid, I was really passionate riddle solver until owners of my favorite riddle game shut down the website. That passion led me to create my own browser-based riddle game and so I started programming.

Here is my personal area to share *generally* technical things. If you think that I'm wrong about something or you have better solution than mine, you are free to comment with any wording you want. I don't care how rude or disrespectful you are as long as you are right and teach me something I don't know.

Like I said, here is my personal area and having the title "mostly java stuff" doesn't mean that I will write only technical things. You shouldn't be surprised if I write something to criticize people who watch only American movies & tv series or if I criticize people who don't like poem or if I write something about [god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDeljko_Obradovi%C4%87). ;)

Cheers,
